// The main problem is that when you call a function on the model that returns a runnable you loose access to the original model.
// Which means that for any model specific configuration function (in this case "bind tools") you need to call that first, which is annoying.
// An even bigger limitation is that you can only call one model specific configuration function as you'll get back a generic RunnableBinding.

// What we need is access to the model that is bound to the runnable.
// There are many solutions to this.

// The approach I've taken is extending the RunnableBinding to add bind tools to it. It could also hold any additional functions for configuration.
// Upsides:
// simple and adding additional configuration functions is straightforward.
// no breaking changes

// Downside is that The model needs to manually override any function that returns RunnableBinding to return this new class.



// I have a hunch there could be a mare generic way of doing this. RunnableBinding could be modified to proxy certain function calls to the bound object.
// providing types for this would probably be annoying.



// The tradeoff would need to be made based on the amount of classes that would need to expose additional configuration functions.
