# Google Finance Tool
The Google Finance Tool allows your agent to utilize the Google Finance API to retrieve financial data, such as stock prices, market trends, 
exchange rates, and other investment-related information from Google Finance.

## Setup
You should get the API key first before using the Tool. To get the key, first  browse the website 
(https://serpapi.com/users/sign_in) sign in with your github or google accountfrom () and follow the instruction to get the 
free plan. (SerpAPI offers Google Finance API as part of its service) After you log in to your SerpApi account, you should 
see your API key listed in "Your Account - Your Private API Key". After you get the key, set your API key as 
`process.env.SERPAPI_API_KEY` or pass it in as an apiKey constructor argument.
