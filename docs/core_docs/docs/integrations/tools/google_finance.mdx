# Google Finance Tool
The Google Finance Tool allows your agent to utilize the Google Finance API to retrieve financial data, such as stock prices, market trends, 
exchange rates, and other investment-related information from Google Finance.

## Setup
Before using the tool, ensure you have your API key. You can create an account on [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/users/sign_in) and obtain your API key
under **Your Private API Key** in your account dashboard. The Google Finance API is included in the free plan offered by SerpAPI.
Once you have the key, set it as `process.env.SERPAPI_API_KEY` or pass it as the `apiKey` argument when initializing the tool.

## Usage
